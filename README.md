# Map-Animation

## Description
Map Animation assignment for MIT xPro Course: Certificate in Coding

This project was called "Real Time Bus Tracker" and the stater code showed bus stops near the MIT campus. My job was to choose another location, obtain my own key on Mapbox, and to show the stops at the location of my choosing. My Real Time Bus Tracker shows stops from Rutherford to NY Penn Station. 

## How to Run

To watch the animation, click the button at the top of the screen that says "Show Stops Between Rutherfordand NY Penn Station"
On the click, the pin with move through each bus stop on the route from Rutherford to NY Penn Station.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

This is a fun project that always has room to grow because it can be applied to any area. I choose a route that I personally take, however it does not take that many stops to get from where I love to NY Penn Station. Had I chose a location less personal I would have been able to show more stops along a route. To adapt and build over time I would choose another location with many more stops. I would love to explore playing with the timing and also labeling each stop along the way with the street name/location.
